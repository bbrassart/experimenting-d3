**Experimenting D3**

This example was mainly created to show the GithubD3 Javascript library in action.
It uses all the default options of this library, meaning it will behave as follows:

- It currently will display a tooltip with the details of the Github project the user is hovering.
That can be extended using the optional callbacks (`options.onMouseover` and `options.onMouseout`) that are currently not used.
